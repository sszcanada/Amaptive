# Amaptive Explained by ChatGPT

Amaptive is a collaborative project between SSZ Canada and ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. The project consists of two versions: Amaptive Junior and Amaptive Senior.

Amaptive Junior is a light-duty robot designed for educational and research purposes. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a combination of a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a 3V-6V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega. The robot is equipped with sensors and is capable of autonomous movement and decision-making using machine learning algorithms.

Amaptive Senior is a larger version of the robot, designed for more advanced research and industrial applications. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a Nema 17 stepper motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega Pro. The robot is equipped with more advanced sensors and has increased computational power, allowing for more complex machine learning tasks.

Both versions of the Amaptive robot are open-source and can be modified and customized for a variety of purposes. The project aims to advance the field of robotics and AI, and promote education and innovation in these areas.

The robot has a sleek, futuristic design, with a clear body that allows the internal mechanisms to be visible. The robot is equipped with a variety of sensors, including ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, and RFID readers. The robot is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, with a separate controller unit featuring joysticks, graphics LCD screen, and keypad for manual input. The robot is able to navigate its environment using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning techniques, mapping out the layout as it goes.
