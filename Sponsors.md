# Rocksolar
ROCKSOLAR was established in response to the growing need for off-grid power sources and the expanding market for outdoor activities, camping, and emergency/disaster situations. Since being founded in 2017 in the USA by a group of engineers, the company has experienced great success in launching multiple product lines with a focus on off-grid solar power solutions. Rocksolar is a company that we currently use in our other divisions. The project approached Rocksolar about a partnership after coming to trust their brand.
