# Amaptive
Amaptive is a collaborative project between SSZ Canada and ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. The project consists of two versions: Amaptive Junior and Amaptive Senior.

# Amaptive Junior
Amaptive Junior is a light-duty robot designed for educational and research purposes. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a combination of a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a 3V-6V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega. The robot is equipped with sensors and is capable of autonomous movement and decision-making using machine learning algorithms.

# Amaptive Senior
Amaptive Senior is a larger version of the robot, designed for more advanced research and industrial applications. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a Nema 17 stepper motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega Pro. The robot is equipped with more advanced sensors and has increased computational power, allowing for more complex machine learning tasks.

# Features
- Sleek, futuristic design with a clear body that allows the internal mechanisms to be visible
- Equipped with a variety of sensors, including ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, and RFID readers
- Controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, with a separate controller unit featuring joysticks, graphics LCD screen, and keypad for manual input
- Able to navigate its environment using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning techniques, mapping out the layout as it goes

# Project Goals
The goals of the Amaptive project are to:

- Advance the field of robotics and AI
- Promote education and innovation in these areas
- Provide an open-source platform for researchers and educators to build upon and customize for their own purposes

# License
Amaptive is released under the MIT License.
