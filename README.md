# Amaptive
The Amaptive project is a collaborative open-source project developed by SSZ Canada and utilizing the advanced language model capabilities of ChatGPT developed by OpenAI. The project aims to create a modular, customizable, and adaptable robot platform using affordable and readily available components, advanced technologies such as AI and VR, and 3D printable components. The goal of the project is to advance the field of robotics and AI, promote education and innovation, and provide an open-source platform for researchers and educators to build upon and customize for their own purposes.

The Amaptive project aims to create a modular, customizable, and adaptable robot platform that utilizes advanced technologies such as AI and VR to control and navigate the robot. The platform is designed to be used for various applications such as education, research, and industry.

The Amaptive platform is built with affordable and readily available components, and utilizes 3D printable components that can be produced at home whenever possible. The goal of the project is to advance the field of robotics and AI, promote education and innovation in these areas, and provide an open-source platform for researchers and educators to build upon and customize for their own purposes.

The platform is currently in its early stages of development, with the focus currently on the wheel modules. The wheel modules are designed to be modular in nature, and feature a custom design that is printed in Blue PLA. The motor housing is 33.49 x 116.3 x 52.5 mm and is designed to hold a combination of a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a 3V-6V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino Nano. The wheels have a 1:1 ratio gear system with 3 gears, 1 attached to the metal shaft, 1 attached to the stepper, and 1 attached to the DC motors.

The Amaptive platform will be equipped with a variety of sensors and is capable of autonomous movement and decision-making using machine learning algorithms. The platform will also feature a Lidar unit, consisting of 3 Time-of-flight sensors, 2 9g servers, a stepper motor, and an Arduino Nano inside. The platform above the wheels will have the brain, the lidar, and a quick-release platform which can be configured for different tasks.

The project is currently open-source and released under the MIT License. The team encourages community involvement and contributions to the project's development. The Amaptive project also plans to develop a community around the project through open-source collaboration and active engagement. The parts list include 2020 Aluminum Extrusion, Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3, 60000mah Mini Power Bank, 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor, ULN2003 Module, 5V DC Motor, DRV8833 Or L298N Module, 5kg Load Cell with HX711 Module, NRF24L01+PA+LNA RF Transceiver Module with SMA Antenna 2.4 GHz 1100M, and many other sensors and modules.

The robot is using a 30000mAh Mini Solar Power Bank Portable External Battery and equipped with Micro USB Type C Qi Fast Wireless Charger Receiver pads allowing the robot to charge without battery removal. The robot's wheels have a modular design, using a housing for the motors which is modular in nature. The design is using 8mm steel axel sat between 2 608zz bearings and using a TPU bracket to attach the wheel to the center of a PLA wheel rim.

The robot is using a custom design for the motor housing which is 33.49 x 116.3 x 52.5 and is printed in Blue PLA. The robot is using a 1:1 ratio gear system with 3 gears, 1 attached to the metal shaft, 1 attached to the stepper, and 1 attached to the DC motors. The goal of the project is to advance the field of robotics and AI, promote education and innovation in these areas, and provide an open-source platform for researchers and educators to build upon and customize for their own purposes. The robot is equipped with a variety of sensors and is capable of autonomous movement and decision-making using machine learning algorithms. The platform will be modular in design, allowing for easy customization and expansion. The robot will be powered by a combination of solar panels and a rechargeable battery. It will be controlled via a wireless connection to a computer running Unreal Engine. The project is currently open-source and released under the MIT License.
