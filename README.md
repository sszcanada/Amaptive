# Amaptive
Amaptive is a collaborative project between SSZ Canada and ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. The project consists of two versions: Amaptive Junior and Amaptive Senior.

# Amaptive Junior
Amaptive Junior is a light-duty robot designed for educational and research purposes. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a combination of a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a 3V-6V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega. The robot is equipped with sensors and is capable of autonomous movement and decision-making using machine learning algorithms.

# Amaptive Senior
Amaptive Senior is a larger version of the robot, designed for more advanced research and industrial applications. It features 4 wheels, each powered by a Nema 17 stepper motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega Pro. The robot is equipped with more advanced sensors and has increased computational power, allowing for more complex machine learning tasks.

# Features
- Sleek, futuristic design with a clear body that allows the internal mechanisms to be visible
- Equipped with a variety of sensors, including ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, and RFID readers
- Controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, with a separate controller unit featuring joysticks, graphics LCD screen, and keypad for manual input
- Able to navigate its environment using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning techniques, mapping out the layout as it goes
- Modular design, allowing for a wide range of configurations and capabilities.
- Incorporation of advanced technology such as Intel NUC (Senior) and Unreal Engine for advanced AI and VR capabilities.
- Use of powerful MindMaker AI plugin for control and map processing.
- Wheel modules with DC, stepper, and steel axel motors, with modular motor housing and 3D printed TPU seals.
- Use of TPU in wheel design for added durability and flexibility.
- Incorporation of load cell for weight sensing and measurement capabilities.
- 3D printed gears for increased precision and reliability.
- 2020 extrusion frame for added stability and strength.
- Support for a wide range of additional sensors and components.

# Project Goals
The goals of the Amaptive project are to:

- create a modular, customizable, and adaptable robot platform
- utilize advanced technologies such as AI and VR to control and navigate the robot
- design 3D printable components that can be produced at home
- create a platform that can be used for various applications such as education, research, and industry
- develop a community around the project through open-source collaboration and active engagement.
- make the project accessible to others for further development and use
- use affordable and readily available components
