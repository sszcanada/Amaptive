# Wheel Module v0.1

The v0.1 engine module design currently uses a combination of a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a 3V-6V DC motor, controlled by an Arduino Mega. The design uses 8mm steel axel sat between 2 608zz bearings and using a TPU bracket to attach the wheel to the center of a PLA wheel rim. The robot is using a custom design for the motor housing which is 33.49 x 116.3 x 52.5 and is printed in Blue PLA. The robot is using a 1:1 ratio gear system with 3 gears, 1 attached to the metal shaft, 1 attached to the stepper, and 1 attached to the DC motors.

# Planned features of v0.2

- Switching from 608zz bearings to 604zz bearings and reducing the axel diameter from 8mm to 4mm on the Junior wheel modules to further reduce the overall footprint of the wheel modules.
- Moving the control modules to the center of the axel module, along with an Arduino Nano, to reduce the overall footprint and increase scalability.
- Adding a quick-release mechanism for the axel, to allow for easy and quick replacement of the wheels.
- Adding a secondary power source for the wheel modules to be powered independently from the brain module with solar charging capability and Qi charging.
- Utilizing JST Connectors for communication between the brain module and the wheel modules
- Moving control modules to center along with Arduino Nano to further reduce overall footprint of the wheel modules.
- Incorporating a new ratio gear system

# Planned for later versions

- Making the wheel modules self-propelling so they can move to a fresh base if needed.
